PHP-Kata
========

Various PHP Kata practices I'm working on. Currently, the goal is to implement each of the patterns in the GoF Design Patterns book to help me learn how the patterns work and to practice TDD. The emphasis is on the design patterns, not functional software, so implementing code is kept at a minimum to get the tests to pass. I.e. there might be obvious checks that should be made inside functions which I haven't implemented.
